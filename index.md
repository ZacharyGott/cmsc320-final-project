## Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately predicting the price of a used car is an important challenge with many complexities. It has great value for both consumers and professional members of the automobile industry. This project focuses on understanding which factors strongly influence the selling price of used cars and on developing a predictive model that can estimate prices based on those factors. Since car purchases are one of the largest financial decisions made by many individuals, accurate pricing is essential for helping consumers avoid overpaying and helping sellers accurately value their vehicles.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of our analysis extends beyond individual transactions; pricing insights can also help dealerships, online marketplaces, and businesses make large-scale decisions. This investigation centers on several key questions: Which characteristics are most strongly correlated with selling price? How accurately does a machine learning model predict used car prices using these features? What patterns about the used vehicle market can be revealed through this analysis? How can these patterns be utilized to benefit both consumers and sellers of the industry? Our project aims to answer these questions through the study of the Vehicle Sales dataset from Kaggle. The predictive model provides key insights which can help anyone improve their decision-making in the used vehicle marketplace.
